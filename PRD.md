# Planning Guide

Infinity Spark is an educational game-world builder where learning feels like play, play creates assets, and assets have real value derived from function. Through a neural slot machine interface and 12 canonical world types, users create playable learning environments that are also tradable tokens.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Play as Learning** - Educational concepts emerge through game mechanics, interactive worlds, and discovery-driven exploration
2. **Neural Creation** - Slot machine interface combines user intent with behavior signals (timing, cursor movement, hesitation) to generate unique world combinations
3. **Function as Value** - Assets gain worth through uniqueness, reusability, tool diversity, and time spent building (not idle)

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality, likely with multiple views)
This is a playful learning platform with 12 world archetypes (physics playgrounds, logic gyms, research libraries, quantum visualizers, dreamscape architects, etc.), neural slot-machine creation, game-script recombination, and an emulator separation model. Users build educational game-worlds that teach through interaction while generating tradable tokens. The system enforces originality through anti-clone mechanics and values creation over replication.

## Essential Features

### 1. Neural Slot Machine (Creation Interface)
- **Functionality**: Giant slot machine UI with emoji reels that combine user intent with behavior signals (click rhythm, hover time, cursor movement, hesitation patterns) to generate unique world-websites
- **Purpose**: Make creation feel playful while capturing nuanced user preferences through interaction patterns
- **Trigger**: User presses CREATE button on home screen
- **Progression**: Button press → Reels spin with emojis 🎰🍄⚙️📀👑🧲 → Analyze timing/movement/prior history → Classify into world archetype → Generate live website with 1-3 tools → Mint 1 token
- **Success criteria**: Every spin produces a working website, emoji combinations determine world type and rarity, behavior signals influence tool selection, rare combinations yield higher valuations

### 2. 12 Canonical World Archetypes (Learning Environments)
- **Functionality**: Pre-designed world types that combine education, play, and productivity: Slot Forge, Mario-Scale Physics, Game Script Genome Lab, Neural Cart Playground, World Stitcher, Playable Research Library, Intent Magnet Arena, Logic & Reasoning Gym, Game-to-Film Studio, Quantum Playground, Emulator Dock, Dreamscape Architect
- **Purpose**: Provide structured yet flexible learning environments where each world teaches different skills through game mechanics
- **Trigger**: Determined by neural slot machine output or user selection
- **Progression**: World type selected → Educational goal identified → Interactive tools loaded → Game mechanics activated → Learning through play begins
- **Success criteria**: Each world has distinct visual identity, unique mechanics, clear educational purpose, and appropriate toolset

### 3. Anti-Clone Originality System
- **Functionality**: Automatically detects when two worlds share identical tools, layout, and logic, then reduces value of both to enforce uniqueness
- **Purpose**: Force creativity and prevent lazy replication, making truly original worlds more valuable
- **Trigger**: Runs on every new world creation and periodically on existing worlds
- **Progression**: Scan world → Compare tools/layout/logic → Calculate similarity score → If > 90% match found → Reduce both worlds' values → Notify owners
- **Success criteria**: Duplicate worlds lose value, original combinations maintain value, users are incentivized to create unique worlds

### 4. World-Specific Value Calculation
- **Functionality**: Calculate world value based on: base world type value, tool diversity multiplier, uniqueness score, script reuse by others, active building time (not idle), and world combination rarity
- **Purpose**: Make functional, original, and useful worlds more valuable than copied or idle ones
- **Trigger**: On creation, tool addition, world stitching, and when other users reference/reuse components
- **Progression**: Action occurs → Calculate base value → Apply multipliers (diversity, uniqueness, reuse) → Penalize clones → Update token value → Display in wallet
- **Success criteria**: Unique worlds worth more, tool diversity increases value, clone detection reduces value, idle time doesn't accumulate value

### 5. Game Script Recombination System (Legal & Safe)
- **Functionality**: Extract and store game logic patterns (jump mechanics, aim systems, spawn rules, score logic) as reusable genomes WITHOUT copying assets, sprites, sounds, or maps
- **Purpose**: Learn from existing games to build new ones while staying completely legal and educational
- **Trigger**: User uploads script/logic snippet or connects external emulator
- **Progression**: Script uploaded → Parse mechanics → Tag patterns (movement, collision, state) → Store as genome → Make reusable → User combines genomes into new worlds
- **Success criteria**: Only logic extracted (no assets), genomes are reusable building blocks, combinations create new games, stays legally clean

### 6. Emulator Separation Model (Critical Legal Boundary)
- **Functionality**: Spark NEVER hosts emulators or ROMs; instead provides containers where users bring their own emulators/ROMs, while Spark only reads and extracts logic patterns
- **Purpose**: Stay completely legal while enabling game-based learning and mechanic extraction
- **Trigger**: User navigates to Emulator Dock world
- **Progression**: User provides emulator → User provides ROM → Runs in isolated container → Spark reads scripts/mechanics only → User extracts logic patterns → Uses patterns in new creations
- **Success criteria**: Zero emulators hosted by Spark, zero ROMs stored, only logic/mechanics extracted, clear legal separation maintained

### 7. Neural Cart System (AI Delegation)
- **Functionality**: Tiny thinking agents (NeuralMcarts) that each perform one cognitive job: chooser, explorer, optimizer, chaos injector - users employ them like workers within their worlds
- **Purpose**: Teach AI delegation and modular thinking through playful worker management
- **Trigger**: Available in Neural Cart Playground world and employable in other worlds
- **Progression**: User selects cart type → Assign to task in world → Cart performs specialized function → Results feed back → Unique cart combinations increase world value
- **Success criteria**: Each cart has distinct behavior, carts work together, users learn delegation patterns, rare cart combinations add value

### 8. World Stitcher (Cross-Domain Synthesis)
- **Functionality**: Combine mechanics from multiple worlds to create hybrid learning environments (e.g., helicopter drop mechanic + Mario gravity + desert map + logic puzzle)
- **Purpose**: Teach systems interoperability and creative synthesis across different domains
- **Trigger**: User selects World Stitcher archetype or uses stitch action in existing world
- **Progression**: Select source worlds → Choose mechanics from each → Define interaction rules → Generate hybrid world → Test for compatibility → Mint high-rarity token if domains are distant
- **Success criteria**: Mechanics from different worlds work together, incompatibilities detected early, successful stitches create unique valuable worlds

### 9. Playable Research Library (Knowledge as Space)
- **Functionality**: Research topics become explorable rooms where charts are doors, videos are windows, simulations are interactive toys, and knowledge is spatial navigation
- **Purpose**: Replace scrolling text walls with interactive spatial exploration for better learning retention
- **Trigger**: User creates Research Library world or adds research to any world
- **Progression**: Topic selected → Research generated → Spatial layout created → Interactive elements placed → Citations become links → User explores physically
- **Success criteria**: No scrolling walls of text, everything is clickable/explorable, research cited by others increases value, spatial metaphors aid understanding

### 10. Intent Magnet Arena (Behavioral Creation)
- **Functionality**: User creates worlds without typing — system infers intent purely from mouse movement, tap patterns, hesitation, and cursor behavior
- **Purpose**: Teach subconscious decision-making and demonstrate human-machine interaction through pure behavior
- **Trigger**: User selects Intent Magnet world or enables behavioral mode
- **Progression**: Track mouse/touch → Analyze patterns → Classify intent → Build world from behavior → Show what was inferred → User refines → World evolves
- **Success criteria**: Meaningful worlds built without typing, behavior patterns accurately classified, users understand their own subconscious choices

- **Success criteria**: Each world teaches its domain effectively, mechanics map to concepts, progression feels natural, users retain knowledge

### 12. Self-Growing C13B0 Loop (System Learning)
- **Functionality**: System watches which worlds users keep, observes which tools recur, promotes successful patterns, deprecates boring ones, and carries winning mechanics into next builds
- **Purpose**: Users train the system by building, making the platform smarter over time
- **Trigger**: Runs continuously in background, analyzing usage patterns
- **Progression**: Observe user retention → Track tool popularity → Identify successful world types → Adjust slot machine weights → Promote winning patterns → Deprecate unused mechanics
- **Success criteria**: Popular world types appear more in slot machine, successful tools get prioritized, boring mechanics fade away, system improves without manual tuning

### 13. Token Minting & Value System (Core Economy)
- **Functionality**: Mint tokens when worlds are created with metadata including world type, tool count, rarity score, uniqueness hash - value based on function not hype
- **Purpose**: Make learning assets tradable with real value derived from originality and utility
- **Trigger**: World creation, tool addition, world stitching, script genome creation
- **Progression**: Functional addition → Calculate value (base + multipliers) → Check for clones (penalize if found) → Update token metadata → Mint or update token → Display in wallet
